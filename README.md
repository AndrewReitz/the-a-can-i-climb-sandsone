# the-a-can-i-climb-sandsone

This is a repo for the [Can I Climb at Sandstone, MN](https://sandstone.aclimbing.com/) project. The mission is to educate climbers about proper climbing etiquette regardling climbing on sandstone rock, as well as give them an easy interface to gain knowledge about the recent weather data for the location.

Technology-wise, this is a simple html/js project using open-mateo's free weather API.
