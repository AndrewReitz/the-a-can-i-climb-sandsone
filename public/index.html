    <h1 class="center">Can I climb at Sandstone?</h1>
    <br>
    <p id="data"></p>
    <p>
      *Sandstone, as far as rocks go, is very soft, brittle, and temperamental;
      especially the specific type of sandstone we have available to us in
      Sandstone, Minnesota.
    </p>
    <p>
      These qualities are magnified when the rock is wet. Think of it like a
      sponge: when the sponge is even a little wet, it is flexible and floppy,
      but when it is properly dry, it is stiff. Sometimes, the sponge even
      appears dry on the outside, but the inside is still kind of dampâ€¦
    </p>
    <p class="underline">
      Under no circumstances should sandstone be climbed on in the presence of
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where sponges and sandstone differ is that you can't squeeze it to check
      and see if it's a little damp on the inside. It's simply a waiting game.
      Our current recommendation is to wait a <p class="underline"> minimum of <em>48 hours</em> after
      the last precipitation </p> before climbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there are even more considerations to make after this time has
      passed:
    </p>
    <em>
    <ul>
      <li>How windy has it been since the rain stopped?</li>
      <li>How sunny has it been since the rain stopped?</li>
      <li>Does it feel damp or â€˜mankyâ€™ at this particular boulder problem?</li>
      <li>Is there a lot of foliage or tree cover aroudn this rock, or is it exposed to air out?</li>
      <li>
        Is the problem you are getting on overhung and trapping water and
        humidity under it?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are the holds you want to grab part of the natural drainage system that
        the water follows when drying up?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do the holds feel damp or moist? Do they take chalk off of your fingers
        when you touch them?
      </li>
      <li>Is the top dry but the bottom wet?</li>
    </ul>
      </em>
    <p>
      These are just some <em>examples</em> of things you may want to consider
      before committing to climbing on sandstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      By climbing on sandstone in a questionable state of wetness you risk
      breaking the rock permanently and changing the limited number of climbs
      available to us forever. This is a silly thing to do when it is entirely
      avoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best of luck with the weather, and please make a good decision. <br> 
      Thank you! ðŸ–¤ <br>
